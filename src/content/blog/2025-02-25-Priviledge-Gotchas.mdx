  This one quick trick to allow a program to bind port 443 can waste hours of time!

# What's Rancher Desktop?

[Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) runs a Kubernetes cluster in a VM on your desktop.
It'll automatically forward ports from the VM, but the host OS typically won't allow programs to
bind ports below `1024`.

## Failure with `setcap`

I tried to use `setcap` to tell the host OS to allow `rancher-desktop` to bind those ports, but this
broke things. Turns out when you empower a program with those kinds of privileges, it is no longer
allowed to load certain shared libraries. This is a security feature to prevent trusted programs from
loading unsecure, potentially malicious libraries.

```sh
# Need the real path to the binary, not a symlink
RANCHER_DESKTOP=$(readlink -f $(which rancher-desktop))
sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $RANCHER_DESKTOP

rancher-desktop # Error, cannot load ./libffmpeg.so
```

## Success with `sysctl`

After I sorted out how `setcap` broke things, I scrapped it and did the simpler, less secure approach
of lowering the start of the protected port range to `80`. On a desktop with no untrusted users,
this is pretty harmless.

```sh
PERM="net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80"
CONF="/etc/sysctl.d/50-unprivileged-ports.conf"
sudo sysctl -w $PERM
sudo bash -c "echo '$PERM' > '$CONF'"
```

## Why are some ports protected?

In short, it's a holdover from when computers were shared by many users. I'll leave it to a greybeard:
