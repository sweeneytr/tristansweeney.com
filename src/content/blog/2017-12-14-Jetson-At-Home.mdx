# Jetson at Home

I have a couple of CUDA-capable devices though my house (go NVIDIA!) but they
mostly are running Windows (because Microsoft Office and Video games) or have
wimpy laptop GPUs. I had a homework assignment dictating I wrote a CUDA program
and the system we had access to was slammed with users, which led to me
stressing over how to get the work done. Was I going to have to download CUDA
on a Windows machine and deal with development on Windows?

    Jetson to the rescue! I got a TX1 for free at SC15 because I was fanboying
    real hard, and it's saving my academic bacon.

# Flashing the Jetpack

You can follow Huy Le's tutorial over at [Sloth Paradise](https://www.slothparadise.com/setup-cuda-7-0-nvidia-jetson-tx1-jetpack-detailed/)
on how to install the Jetpack on the Jetson. The CUDA version in the l4t folder
is 8.0 on the latest Jetpack release, but the post is otherwise spot-on. Huy and
I were part of a supercomputing team out of Boston, he knows his stuff.

# Linux Modules

Checkout [my jetson-lmod repo](https://github.com/sweeneytr/jetson-lmod)
which sets up the lmod (lua-modules) package, allowing users to load and
unload 'environment modules'. These modules set environment variables when
loaded to add software to the current environment, and unset those variables
when unloaded to remove that software from the environment. It's a bit like
adding environment variables to the tail end of a `bashrc` file, but infinitely
more powerful and flexible.

That repo includes a sample module that can be loaded and unloaded to add and
remove the CUDA installation to/from the path. For some healthy reading on how
to write modules, here's the [documentation](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Accessing the GPU

If you add a user, you'll be troubled to find that any attempt to run CUDA by
them is met with a friendly "No device found" error. This was due to the user
not being a member of the `video` group, which controls access to the graphics
devices.

To fix this, simply `sudo usermod <username> -a -G video` and relogin to the
system, but we'll still need to perform this fix whenever a new user is added.
Given this is a dev-board that only trusted people can access, we can instead
configure `adduser` to provide new users access to all the hardware in
the system. To do this, open `/etc/adduser.conf` and uncomment/set the below
values. You <b>could</b> also add `sudo` to that list of default groups, but
that's playing with fire.

```bash
EXTRA_GROUPS="dialout cdrom floppy audio video plugdev users"
ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS=1
```

# Setup the Login Node

As discussed by Huy, to flash the Jetpack onto the TX1, you'll need a Ubuntu
14.04 host machine. Rather than a VM, I just loaded 14.04 onto an old laptop to
use as an access node for my home LAN. I forwarded TCP port 22 (the ssh port)
from my router to that <u data-qtip="craptop">laptop</u>, from which I could
access the TX1 freely. You could directly forward the port to the Jetson, but
I didn't want to have a specialized device be the gateway to my LAN.

You'll need to ensure `openssh-server`, or another ssh server application is
installed on the login node (it'll be installed by Jetpack on the jetson). On
Ubuntu this is as simple as:

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

<p id="craptop" class="qtip-tip">
  Affectionately named 'craptop' to distinguish it in my home DNS from the
  laptop I regularly use.

  different router you'll need to do some research.{" "}

First, we'll have to pin down the IP address assigned to the login-node in the
DHCP server running on the router. Without doing this, a device could be
reassigned a different address and no longer be properly forwarded ports.

<img src="/images/jetson_at_home/advanced.PNG" alt="advanced" />

Head to [myfiosgateway.com](myfiosgateway.com), and login with the credentials
on the side of your router. Click into Advanced, IP Address Distribution,
Connection list to see the current DHCP leases.

<img src="/images/jetson_at_home/connections.PNG" alt="connections" />

Find your device, and click the pencil icon to edit it's lease. Find the
checkbox labeled "Static Lease Type" and check it, which will pin that IP
address in the local range to that MAC address. This permanently assigns that IP
address to the device currently connected to it.

If when browsing for the device in the DHCP connections list you found that it
had a name different from what you wanted it to be assigned in the DNS server,
head back to the advanced tab, click into DNS Server, and click the pencil icon
next to the name you want to change (you'll notice a record must be statically
assigned to modify it's name). From there, simply enter a new hostname and
click apply.

<img src="/images/jetson_at_home/main.PNG" alt="main" />

Click back to the main menu, then into port forwarding under quick links.

<Image src={ports} alt="ports" />

Select the login node from the 'Select IP from menu' dropdown and 'Custom Ports'
from the 'Application to forward' menu. In the new context that appears, select
TCP port 22, and hit add.

# Testing the Connection

Find your public IP address (The address of the router in the global internet)
on the main page of the router's screen or by other means, and attempt to SSH
into it. If your connection was forwarded, huzzah! Otherwise... not huzzah?
Check if the login node and Jetson properly have `openssh-server` installed by
locally attempting to ssh into the machines, and check your port forwarding. If
things look good and it's still not working, ensure you set a static IP for the
login-node.

To improve your quality of life, you can create an A Name Record with a DNS
provider for your router if you pay to lease a domain name. I created a
subdomain within one I own to save on dough, but the world is your oyster. It's
unlikely your router's IP will change, but if it does, you can use a dynamic DNS
service to update your DNS records on-the-fly as your provider changes your
public IP.
