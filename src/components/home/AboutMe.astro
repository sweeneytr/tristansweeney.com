  <p>
    Hi! I'm Tristan, a full-stack software engineer that brings together
    technologies that are a joy to work with. I've seen firsthand that the right
    tools save immense time and effort, making teams productive, confident, and
    happy to work together.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been programming since 2012, and worked accross all sorts of software
    and hardware projects. From designing processors, circuit boards, and
    firmware to supercomputing, web development and mobile apps, I've been
    around the block.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love depth and details, but have found myself valuing "impact" above all
    else when it comes to technical work. Being down in the weeds can be fun,
    but I'm going to stay up-town for a while, in the land of "delivering value
    to customers".
  </p>

  <p>
    Hopefully those that I've already had the pleasure of working with don't
    think this site sells me short, or streches the truth too thinly. If it
    does... the site's in github, open an issue!
  </p>
